<p>In a sense, the term "Functional Programming" share a property with the term "Object Oriented Programming": They are both ill-defined.
Most of the people who use those two terms does not have a clear definition of them.</p>
<p>Before I express my argument, I want to pose two rhetorical question: 
To Most People(I am arguing that (Most of the people who use "FP" and "OOP"), not ("FP" and "OOP") does not have a clear definition)
(I am not repeating the parse "To Most People" anymore, but this should be clear),
What is a Functional Programming Language? What is not?</p>
<p>Haskell, OCaml, Scheme are Functional Programming Language, while C, C++ and Java is not, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now what can we do now is clear: We can just look at feature FP claim to have over non FP, and test it to the above list. Let's Start!</p>
<p>Functions as first class object: C++ Has it.</p>
<p>Referential Transparency: OCaml and Scheme doesn't</p>
<p>Automatic Currying: Scheme again</p>
<p>Expressive Type System: C++ has a Turing Complete Type System</p>
<p>Type Inference: C++ has a little, while Scheme has none</p>
<p>My point is, there is a measurement of "FPness", but it is extremely vague and ill defined to most people: 
therefore, I recommend people to describe the feature the language has directly (Haskell has advance type inference) 
instead of claiming a Language is FPL(Haskell is a Functional Programming Language). About the same amount of words to type/speak, and clearer, isn't it?</p>
