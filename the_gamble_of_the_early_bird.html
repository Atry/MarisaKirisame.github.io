<h1> The gamble of the early bird </h1>
<p>Let's say you haven't graduate from high school yet (Or else you don't need to read this).<br>
Let's also say that you have an idea of your future profession (for example, you want to be a programmer).<br> 
What should you do to make your dream come true?<br>
Obviously, there's not anything you can do, beside studying/practicing your future profession now. But should you?<br>
Like everyone else, you have 24 hour per day, and if you want to spent time on it, you have to draw you time on something else – school.<br> 
Is it worth doing so? It depend! But no matter what you choose, this is a life-changing gamble.<br>
And this article is to help you analyze, and to make your decision.</p>

<h3>First, let's look at your chip – what you will sacrifice.</h3>
<p>1 : Academic Performance: this is obvious.</p>

<p>2 : General Education: School does not just randomly choose some topic and stuff it in the agenda: it will probably have some use later on.</p>

<p>3 : Your future University Ranking. <br>
Your standardize test score will drop in accordance to your Academic Performance.<br>
And no, unless you are THAT good(something in the level of winning international competition), 
your loss cannot be compensated by what you gain – remember, 
the one reading your personal statement don't have the time to distinguish you from someone who fake their extracurricular activities using Wikipedia.</p>

<h3>What will you gain?</h3>
<p>1 : Decisive amount of Knowledge and Experience in your field.<br> 
If you start specializing in junior high, you'll have spent 6-7 years on your subject – 
the time it took to go from undergrad to get a master degree.<br>
While due to no-guidance, you probably will be less effective to learn by yourself, it is enough to enable you to stay top-notch against your peer.<br> 
Even if you start later/put in less effort, it is significantly better than having virtually none of it.</p>

<p>2 : Habit/Knowledge that you acquire along.<br>
You probably will develop a good study/work habit, have better self-discipline, and know how to do academic research on your own.<br> 
You will also learn about the prerequisite knowledge(for example, discrete mathematic if you are doing CS) of your field.</p>

<p>3 : University that suit you better.<br> 
If you have not decide your major, how will you choose a university that can give you top-notch education?<br> 
Ooh, let's apply to havard/mit*!<br>
What if you decided to be a programmer?<br>
That's easy, apply to the big four(CMU, MIT, UCB, Stanford*)!<br> 
What if you decided to do Formal Verification(Don't worry if you don't know what it is, you just need to know it's a branch of CS)?<br>
CMU, MIT, Texas Austin, UW*!<br>
As you can see, as you focus on more specific field, the competition will be easier, and you can receive better education in the field.</p>

<h3>What else should you consider before deciding?</h3>

<p>1 : How much prerequisite are there? If the answer is “a lot”, it help to do good in school.</p>

<p>2 : Does it need formal teaching/special equipment? Think twice if you want to learn chemistry on your own.</p>

<p>3 : How much of your skill can transfer after you graduate from academia? It doesn't make sense to learn Symbian app development now.</p>

<p>4 : What will you do in university? You should come up of a better answer than “relearning everything”.</p>

<p>5 : How much work does it take to grasp the basic knowledge in your field?<br>
It doesn't make sense to learn “half of a language”:<br>
you need to put all the piece together so that it make sense to you intuitively, or you will forget it, sooner or later.<br> 
If the key concept is difficult to learn, think twice if you do not want to spend too much time specializing.</p>

<h3>If you had decided that you will specialize early, here's what you also need to do.</h3>

<p>1 : Talk to your parent. Even in the worse case, they are your income source, and you cant go far without their support.</p>
<p>2 : Join some on-line community. It will help you to learn, and connect you to future career opportunity/really cool and helpful people.</p>
<p>3 : Do some research on how the field actually is.<br>
If you do not do so, your depiction of what you will do may be hopelessly wrong.<br> 
Don't let your inaccurate perception have a chance to determine the rest of your life.</p>

<p>That's it. If you have question don't hesitate to email me/others, since your decision will have great impact on yourself.</p>
